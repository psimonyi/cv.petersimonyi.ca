<h2 id='ra'>Ra: interaction history study</h2>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>My MCS thesis was based on this project.  The focus was on the usability
evaluation user study I ran, so the design shown here is only what I tested — I
learned a lot and would make some significant revisions, which you can <a

>read in the thesis</a> (skip to section 5.8 and chapter 6).</p>

<p>What would happen if we could give tools like Git to users of web apps?  In
particular, could we support the kind of exploratory “have fun with this data”
app that’s becoming more common with better data processing and touchscreens
and other new interaction media?</p>

<h3>Interaction history sidebar</h3>

<img src='ra-8-done-again.png'>

<p>I wrote a JavaScript library that hooks into a web application.  It provides
the blue sidebar in the page that automatically tracks changes in application
state and lets the user jump arbitrarily to any node in the tree.  Making
changes while the current node is not a leaf node starts a new branch.  Thus,
all states the application has been in are saved.</p>

<p>Ra is a library that runs in the context of the app mostly to make the
implementation easier.  Taking snapshots from the level of the JavaScript
virtual machine would have been a technically interesting approach, but I
wasn't prepared to try to rewrite parts of the JavaScript interpreter!</p>

<p>The interaction history tree is in a sidebar because I wanted to make it
seem quite separate from the application, both to the end user and to the
application developer.  (One of my conclusions after the study was that this
should change: the sidebar is distracting when you don’t need it.)</p>

<h3>Manipulating history</h3>

<p>Ra automatically saves states, and a major goal is to enable fearless
exploration, so those states are immutable and the tree of states is
append-only.  So “manipulating history” is not something Ra supports, though
the user study suggests more control over the view is needed.</p>

<p>Users don't always know in advance when they will want to refer back to some
state, but for when they do, Ra can make special star nodes in the tree with
custom labels.</p>

<img src='ra-star-new.png'>

<p>For browsing the history tree, each node has a pop-up balloon that appears
on hover (for mouse operations) or tap (for touchscreen operations).  The nodes
are fairly large because the study was run on a large wall-mounted touchscreen.
For the mouse hovering case, the actual hit target for moving the mouse off is
invisibly larger than for moving the mouse on, so it's harder to accidentally
dismiss the balloon while trying to use it.  The balloons give the node's
creation time and a summary if one is available (such as when the user
explicitly created a starred node), though these features turned out to be less
useful for the tasks I tested.</p>

<h3>Usability evaluation</h3>

<p>I conducted a usability evaluation in which participants used a couple of
demo applications for a series of tasks.  The first few tasks were mostly to
introduce features and let them get comfortable using the software (and
hardware).  The later tasks were intended to elicit exploratory behaviour
without being too complicated, since I had to keep the study time to a
reasonable time limit.  The more successful task was a large maze with multiple
targets and multiple paths through the maze.</p>

<p>After working with the system, participants filled out a short
questionnaire.  But most of the valuable data came from observations of what
they tried to do, or wasted time on, while working with the system and chatting
with me (as I'd asked them to “think aloud”).  As mentioned above, chapter 6 in 
<a href='https://curve.carleton.ca/c1a2b73e-cb4e-4954-8849-8bf110c995a4'>my
thesis</a> is all about conclusions and what I would change.</p>

<h2 id='photoname'>Photo renaming tool</h2>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Many years ago, I had written a simple batch rename tool which my mother
used as part of her photo-filing workflow.  Since that tool didn’t work with
Windows 10, I took it as an opportunity to do a better job.  The key was that
she didn’t need a generic batch rename tool: she needed a tool specifically for
renaming photos.</p>

<p>Photo filenames end with the sequence number from the camera, preceded by a
letter indicating <i>which</i> camera, and begin with text that is usually but
not always the same as the “Title” metadata field.  Since it’s a digital camera
and taking pictures is almost free, there are usually quite a lot of variations
on the same shot.</p>

<p>The screenshots here were taken under GNOME with some testing data, but
thanks to GTK themes, the window looks quite natural under Windows.</p>

<h3>Main view</h3>

<img src='photoname-main.png'>

<p>If the photo has a “Title” metadata field, that gets filled in as the
default base name.  (The suffix can be seen on the right, but it can’t be
changed.  That’s a feature, since it maintains the filename pattern.)</p>

<p>Photos are grouped together automatically by the default base
name.  In most cases the default name is the one that gets used, so this is
mostly a review step.  The cases I’ve observed where the default name is not
used are all about choosing between English and scientific names, so the
grouping is valid and helpful.</p>

<p>The left side shows the photos being renamed, if there are only two, or the
number in the group and the two that do fit.  I’ve seen her do on the order of
100 at a time, so showing all the photos would be impractical, but having a
couple of thumbnails provides some limited confirmation that it’s the right
photos being renamed.</p>

<h3>Startup</h3>

<img src='photoname-empty.png'>

<p>The tool can be run with files already selected (e.g. from the context menu
or from dragging files to the application icon), in which case it loads the
main screen.  But with several file manager windows open that can be
inconvenient, so dragging files to the main window is also supported.  This
also neatly solves the problem of what to do if you accidentally try to run it
without photos to rename.</p>

<h3>Error handling</h3>

<img src='photoname-warning.png'>

<p>Not all filenames are valid, unfortunately.  And some are just surprising,
like accidentally having two spaces.  Some perfectly reasonable photo titles
fall afoul of Windows’ filename restrictions (like disallowing
<code>&amp;</code>).</p>

<p>Warnings and errors that can be detected in advance are shown with a GTK info
bar that slides down a few hundred milliseconds after typing a problematic
name.  The delay helps avoid warning bounce while typing, but if you press the
Rename button before the warning has popped up, it will bring up the warning
instead.</p>

<p>Since you don’t have to resolve warnings right away, several could build up
on different rows.  And when you first load a batch of photos, there could be
multiple titles that are problematic as filenames.  The info bar can only show
one at a time, and in the initial load case the problem might not be obvious,
so there is a warning marker added to each row with problems so there's no
doubt about where to fix it.</p>

<h2 id='pst'><code>pst</code> process viewer</h2>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>This is a command-line process tree viewer that exists mostly because I kept
adding to a Bash alias <code>ps -eHf</code> and then piping it to
<code>grep</code>.  I wrote it in Rust for speed (especially startup speed)
because while the previous version was Python and I like Python, running this
command happens most often on heavily loaded systems where performance makes a
noticeable difference.</p>

<h3>Defaults and highlighting</h3>
<img src='pst.png'>
<p>I mostly use process listings to look for a single process, and use the
process ancestry tree for context (e.g. to check whether it’s the one I want).
So with no options, the command gives a process tree.  Extra information
columns like username are added as space permits, so even easier than
remembering <code>-d</code> for ‘show more details’ is just maximizing the
terminal window.</p>

<p>And I'm often looking for something in particular, though its name may not
be unique — try searching for a runaway Python process.  So non-flag arguments
are treated as queries and cause matching lines to be highlighted.</p>

<h2 id='titletext'>Show comic title-text extension</h2>

<p>This extension for Firefox started off as a little custom thing just for me,
partly as a way to explore the new WebExtensions API.  It just puts the
title-text below comics so you don't have to hover.  The list of comics was
hard-coded.  When I decided to publish the extension for general use, a
customizable list of rules was clearly needed, and I don't want to ship a set
of comics recognized by default.</p>

<p>The extension doesn't actually add any title-text by default, which is
not a good user experience.  To make up for that, the initial state instead
adds a context menu entry (shown below).  This makes setting up the
configuration easier, but it also makes it obvious that the extension is doing
something after you install it and shows what you have to do to make it
work.</p>

<img src='titletext-contextmenu.png'>

<p>The extension is published on addons.mozilla.org as
<a href='https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/show-titletext/'>Show
comic title-text</a>.</p>

<h2 id='rcweb'>Choir web page</h2>

<p>I offered to make a web page for a choir I sing with, especially so I could
tell people not on Facebook where to get concert information.  The choir has
decided not to pursue it, but I still have the initial version I wanted to put
up.  Its main purpose is to provide information about what was then an upcoming
concert, so I put that up front.</p>

<p>The page is still live on the test site <a
